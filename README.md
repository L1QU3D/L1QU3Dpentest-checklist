## 1. Pre-Engagement

- [ ] Secure Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
- [ ] Collect comprehensive client and system information.
- [ ] Define the scope and rules of engagement clearly.
- [ ] Obtain formal, written authorization for testing.
- [ ] Conduct a detailed risk assessment.
- [ ] Ensure legal compliance for all testing activities.
- [ ] Set specific, measurable success criteria.
- [ ] Establish emergency contact and response protocols.
- [ ] Define data handling and storage protocols.
- [ ] Agree on communication channels and reporting frequency with the client.
- [ ] Ensure the penetration testing team has the necessary skills and certifications.

## 2. Information Gathering

- [ ] Conduct network and application scans (e.g., Nmap, Nessus).
- [ ] Perform web crawling for hidden or dynamic content.
- [ ] Identify and enumerate all subdomains.
- [ ] Search for common vulnerabilities (e.g., default credentials, unpatched systems).
- [ ] Pinpoint potential initial access points.
- [ ] Assess opportunities and methods for social engineering.
- [ ] Execute a comprehensive DNS analysis.
- [ ] Undertake passive information gathering (e.g., Shodan, Censys).
- [ ] Utilize Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques.
- [ ] Perform Google dorking to find potentially sensitive information.
- [ ] Check for information leakage via metadata, HTML comments, etc.

## 3. Vulnerability Analysis

- [ ] Validate and prioritize findings from scans.
- [ ] Test for known vulnerabilities and possible exploits.
- [ ] Analyze applications for common flaws (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
- [ ] Conduct fuzz testing to discover new vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Review server and application configurations for misconfigurations.
- [ ] Perform manual code reviews where feasible.
- [ ] Examine third-party components and libraries.
- [ ] Evaluate the security of wireless and cloud services.
- [ ] Assess authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [ ] Test for insecure direct object references (IDOR).
- [ ] Check for sensitive data exposure (e.g., in URLs, API responses).
- [ ] Analyze mobile app binaries if in scope.

## 4. Exploitation

- [ ] Attempt to gain initial access (e.g., through phishing, exploiting known vulnerabilities).
- [ ] Perform privilege escalation on compromised systems.
- [ ] Explore lateral movements within the network.
- [ ] Document each step of the exploitation process meticulously.
- [ ] Simulate Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) techniques where authorized.
- [ ] Attempt to bypass security controls like WAF, 2FA etc.
- [ ] Test for common misconfigurations (e.g., verbose error messages, directory listing).

## 5. Post-Exploitation

- [ ] Identify and access critical data stores.
- [ ] Simulate data exfiltration, if within the agreed scope.
- [ ] Implement strategies for maintaining access, if necessary.
- [ ] Adhere to secure data handling and processing procedures.
- [ ] Document all system alterations comprehensively.
- [ ] Check for clear-text credentials and sensitive data in memory.
- [ ] Analyze the potential impact of identified vulnerabilities.

## 6. Reporting

- [ ] Create a detailed report documenting tools, techniques, and procedures used.
- [ ] Include evidence such as screenshots and logs.
- [ ] Provide clear, actionable remediation recommendations.
- [ ] Assign risk ratings to all identified vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Prepare an executive summary for stakeholder review.
- [ ] Suggest a timeline for follow-up assessments or retesting.
- [ ] Conduct a read-out meeting with the client to discuss key findings.
- [ ] Provide a technical report as well as an executive summary.

## 7. Remediation Verification

- [ ] Allow a designated period for the client to remediate identified issues.
- [ ] Conduct retests to verify the effectiveness of fixes.
- [ ] Document any unresolved security issues.
- [ ] Recommend strategies for ongoing monitoring and improvement.
- [ ] Advise on the need for security awareness and training programs.
- [ ] Propose a schedule for regular future security audits.
- [ ] Provide guidance on implementing a vulnerability management program.
- [ ] Discuss strategies to improve the security development lifecycle.
